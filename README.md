# Diabetes Feature Engineering

In this project, we will perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing a machine learning model that can predict whether people will have diabetes when their characteristics are specified.


#### Dataset Story:

The dataset is part of the large dataset maintained at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA.
Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA.

The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.
